# Loading and Exporting Data using MySQL
#####  In this project, the goal is for you to load data into a MySQL database, perform an export, destroy the database and load the data back again explaining and documenting the whole process.

##### For this project you will need data previously scraped. You can use either a CSV file or a SQL file to initially load the data into MySQL. You can use the scripts in the sample repo as a reference to create a database, load from a CSV file, or insert data with a SQL file
* https://github.com/alfredodeza/vscode-mysql/tree/main/sql_scripts 
* https://github.com/alfredodeza/vscode-mysql/blob/main/sql_scripts/load_csv.sql
* https://github.com/alfredodeza/vscode-mysql/blob/main/sql_scripts/populate.sql

If you need to create a database from scratch, you can reference this setup SQL script

* https://github.com/alfredodeza/vscode-mysql/blob/main/sql_scripts/setup.sql

Finally, if you are saving data from your Scrapy project, you can  use this sample spider that saves the data in a SQL file as a reference.

Remember, you must use your own data with your own files. The sample files and repositories shouldn't be used directly.

Your Tasks

1. Generate either a CSV file or a SQL file to populate a MySQL database
2. Load the data into MySQL, and then use mysqldump to export everyting into a SQL file.
3. Create a new (empty) database and use the exported data to load everything again. Ensure that all data is present
4. Create a repository, add all relevant files, and a README.md file to your Github project that describes what you did
5. Create a Demo Video and reference it in your GitHub Project.

Sample Deliverables
* Demo video. Here is an example video you can refer to that explains Python decorators.
